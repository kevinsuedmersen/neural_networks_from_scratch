# Neural Networks from Scratch

This repository aims to derive and implement equations for training various neural networks from scratch, such as 

- Multi Layer Perceptrons, i.e. networks with multiple fully connected, dense layers stacked behind each other (In Progress)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (To Do)

and benchmark the performance of our self-derived and self-implemented neural networks against common Deep Learning libraries. 

This repository is for anyone who wants to get a deep understanding of the internals of neural networks, e.g. the mathematical equations and derivations of the forward- and backward propagation algorithm. This repo also assumes that the reader/user has a basic understanding of neural networks and linear algebra. If that is not the case, here are some great resources which might help in understanding all details of this repo:

# Files

Each type of network is explained by a separate document in the `theory` folder and is implemented in the `src` folder.
